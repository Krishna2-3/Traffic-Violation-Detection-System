Advanced Traffic Violation Detection System (v1)
Nov 2024 - Jan 2025Nov 2024 - Jan 2025
Project: Advanced Traffic Violation Detection System (v1)
Tech Stack: YOLOv8, Python, OpenCV, OCR (Tesseract), Custom Dataset

Version 1 of my computer vision-based project focuses on detecting major traffic violations using YOLOv8:

No Helmet

No Seat Belt

Mobile Phone Usage While Driving

Triple Riding

The system is also integrated with an OCR module that extracts license plate numbers of violating vehicles. It's trained and tested on a real-world dataset to ensure practical accuracy.

One key feature in v1 is the ability to process live CCTV footage, enabling real-time violation detection directly from street-level surveillance feeds.

This is just the beginningâ€”future versions will bring even higher accuracy, better performance, and wider violation coverage. My goal is to make this one of the most reliable and scalable traffic enforcement systems out there.
